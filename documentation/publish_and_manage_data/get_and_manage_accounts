<h1 id="get-and-manage-accounts">Get and manage accounts</h1>
<p>There are two levels of access on data.gov.uk: editor and administrator (admin).</p>
<p>Editors are able to publish and manage datasets associated with their organisation (for example, a local authority or central government department). Editors and admins can be in multiple organisations.</p>
<p>Admins have the same abilities as editors but can also:</p>

<ul>
<li>add and remove editors</li>
<li>manage editors’ activity</li>
<li>update information about their organisation(s)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="get-an-account">Get an account</h2>
<h3 id="get-invited-by-an-admin">Get invited by an admin</h3>
<p>To get an account, you should ask an existing admin to invite you. This is the fastest and most reliable way to gain access. The admin can follow these <a href="#add-or-remove-editors-and-admins">instructions for adding/removing accounts</a>.</p>
<h3 id="register-for-an-account">Register for an account</h3>
<p>If there are no admins, or you do not know who the admins for your organisation are, you can <a href="https://data.gov.uk/support">register for an account</a>. This process is slower as it requires a GOV.UK developer to manually process your request.</p>
<p>When completing the form, state whether you need editor or admin permissions.</p>
<h2 id="add-or-remove-editors-and-admins">Add or remove editors and admins</h2>
<p>An organisation can have multiple editors and admins.</p>
<p>As an admin, you can add additional editors or admins to an organisation via the <a href="https://ckan.publishing.service.gov.uk/">Data Publisher</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to the <strong>Publishers</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Go to the name of the organisation, then <strong>Manage</strong> &gt; <strong>Members</strong> &gt; <strong>Add member</strong>.</li>
<li>Add the email address of the user you want to add.</li>
<li>Choose whether you want the user to be an editor or an admin.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Add Member</strong> and add the user’s government email address.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The recipient will receive email instructions on setting up an account.</p>
<p>To remove a user, follow steps 1 and 2. Then select the button with the cross next to their name to remove their permissions.</p>
<h2 id="create-or-edit-an-organisation">Create or edit an organisation</h2>
