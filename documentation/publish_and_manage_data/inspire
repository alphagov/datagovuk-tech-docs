<h1 id="inspire">INSPIRE</h1>
<p>INSPIRE places legal obligations on public bodies to publish particular datasets. This requires most UK public bodies (central government, local authorities and all other public authorities as defined in the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2004/3391/contents/made">Environmental Information Regulations 2004</a>) to publish certain datasets.</p>
<p>Relevant datasets are those which meet all these criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>geo-spatial data (the data points contain a location e.g. latitude/longitude or post code etc)</li>
<li>data that is in any of the <a href="http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/2/list/7">34 INSPIRE themes</a>, however UK Location encourages all geo-spatial data to be published the INSPIRE way</li>
<li>existing data (the law does not compel you to collect any data)</li>
</ul>
<p>Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs (Defra) provides guidance and a helpdesk for INSPIRE queries. Contact the helpdesk at <a href="mailto:UK-INSPIRE-Help@defra.gsi.gov.uk">UK-INSPIRE-Help@defra.gsi.gov.uk</a>.</p>

However the data is Location data - each accident is located using a OS grid reference (and latitude &amp; longitude) so it is geo-spatial. So the publisher could have still published the metadata in GEMINI and provided INSPIRE-style View (WMS) and Download Services (WFS/Atom), but has chosen not to in this case, sticking to basic CSV.</td>

<h2 id="publishing-inspire-location-data">Publishing INSPIRE/Location data</h2>
<p>The INSPIRE legislation requires most geo-spatial data to be published according to certain standards, and be registered on data.gov.uk in a certain way. The records must be published in <a href="../harvest_data/gemini">GEMINI format</a> and be <a href="../harvest_data">harvested</a>. Common ways to do this are:</p>

<ul>
<li>metadata records</li>
<li>storing data in a GIS (Geographic Information System)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="geographic-information-system-gis">Geographic Information System (GIS)</h3>
<p>You can choose to store data in a GIS (Geographic Information System). This is common for departments and local authorities that have an established geo-spatial data capability. The most commonly used GIS for data.gov.uk is the open source <a href="http://geonetwork-opensource.org/">GeoNetwork</a>, and commercial ones such as ArcGIS are also in use. The GIS provides a &lsquo;WMS service&rsquo; for users to preview the data and &lsquo;WFS service&rsquo; or &lsquo;Atom feed&rsquo; for users to download the data. The GIS also publishes the metadata records for the datasets at a &lsquo;CSW service&rsquo;, which data.gov.uk is then configured to harvest from.</p>
<h2 id="harvesting-metadata-records">Harvesting metadata records</h2>
<p>Getting your metadata records into data.gov.uk is done by <a href="../harvest_data">setting up a data.gov.uk &lsquo;harvester&rsquo;</a>. You should run the harvester regularly, to ensure that data.gov.uk stays in sync when the publisher updates the records.</p>
<p>Occasionally publishers have made the mistake of using an existing record as a template and simply using a text editor to change the key fields. The main problem with this is that you need to generate a new <code>gmd:fileIdentifier</code>, or data.gov.uk will harvest it and overwrite the record that was the template! To generate a new UUID (universally unique identifier) for this field, just visit <a href="https://www.uuidgenerator.net/">https://www.uuidgenerator.net/</a>.</p>
