</ol>
<p>You can submit 2 sets of contact details per dataset. One set of contact details should be used for Freedom of Information (FOI) requests only.</p>
<p>You can edit the dataset information after it’s published.</p>
<p>Once you have added information about the dataset, you can add the data itself.</p>

<h2 id="publishing-organograms">Publishing organograms</h2>
<p>Organograms are a description of the roles and salaries in the UK government at a particular point in time. They are an important publication in the government&rsquo;s effort to improve transparency of how the public sector manages resources.</p>
<p>Central government and agencies must publish organograms of all staff positions on data.gov.uk every 3 months. Organograms are published:</p>

<ul>
<li>in a <a href="https://data.gov.uk/search?q=organogram">collection of visualisations</a></li>
<li>as raw data in CSV format</li>
</ul>
<p>Some organisations, such as intelligence agencies, are exempt from publishing organograms.</p>
<p>Local authorities must publish senior staff data in a <a href="http://schemas.opendata.esd.org.uk/OrganisationStructure">different format</a>.</p>
<h3 id="when-to-publish-organograms">When to publish organograms</h3>
<p>You must publish the data 4 times a year. Take a ‘snapshot’ of the roles on:</p>

<ul>
<li>31 March to be published by 30 April</li>
<li>30 June to be published by 31 July</li>
<li>30 September to be published by 30 October</li>
<li>31 December to be published by 31 January</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-to-include">What to include</h3>
<p>You must use the <a href="https://ckan.publishing.service.gov.uk/publisher-files/Blank_Organogram_Template_latest.xls">standard organogram template</a>, adding the details of your department&rsquo;s Senior Civil Service (SCS) pay band 1 and 2 employees.</p>
<h3 id="publish-an-organogram-dataset">Publish an organogram dataset</h3>
<p>Follow these instructions if your organisation does not already have an organogram dataset. The instructions help you publish a new dataset containing an organogram. You can then add future organograms to this dataset.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create your organogram using the <a href="https://ckan.publishing.service.gov.uk/publisher-files/Blank_Organogram_Template_latest.xls">standard organogram template</a>. If you do not use this template, or if you change it (such as removing or adding columns, or renaming them), you&rsquo;ll see an error and your publishing will not work.</li>
<li>Sign into the <a href="https://ckan.publishing.service.gov.uk/">Data Publisher</a>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Datasets</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Add dataset</strong>.</li>
<li>Complete the fields with information about the organogram.</li>
<li>Select the appropriate schema for your organogram. Use:

<ul>
<li><strong>Organisation structure including roles roles &amp; salaries</strong> for central government organograms</li>
<li><strong>Organisation structure (for LGTC by LGA)</strong> for local authority organograms</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Select <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
<li>Upload or link to the organogram and complete the remaining fields.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Publish</strong>.</li>
<li>If an error message appears, read it carefully as errors should be self-explanatory based on validation rules set in the template spreadsheet. Fix any errors in your spreadsheet and click Publish again.</li>
</ol>
<p>A new dataset containing the organogram will be created. Add all future organograms for this organisation to this dataset.</p>
<h3 id="add-an-organogram-to-a-dataset">Add an organogram to a dataset</h3>
<p>If your organisation already has an organogram dataset, you should add all new organograms to that dataset.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create your organogram using the <a href="https://ckan.publishing.service.gov.uk/publisher-files/Blank_Organogram_Template_latest.xls">standard organogram template</a>. If you do not use this template, or if you change it (such as removing or adding columns, or renaming them), you&rsquo;ll see an error and your publishing will not work.</li>
<li>Sign into the <a href="https://ckan.publishing.service.gov.uk/">Data Publisher</a>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Datasets</strong>.</li>
<li>Search for the organogram dataset of your organisation.</li>
<li>Select the dataset.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Manage</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Add data</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Add new resource</strong>.</li>
<li>Link or upload the data.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Publish</strong>.</li>
<li>If an error message appears, read it carefully as errors should be self-explanatory based on validation rules set in the template spreadsheet. Fix any errors in your spreadsheet and click Publish again.</li>
</ol>
<p>The new organogram will be added to the existing dataset.</p>
<h2 id="add-spend-data">Add spend data</h2>
<p>Central and local government bodies (including NHS) must publish the details of their expenditure transactions every month. This guidance explains how to add these details to data.gov.uk.</p>
<h3 id="about-spend-data">About spend data</h3>
<p>Central government must publish spend data one month in arrears. HM Treasury provides <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-publishing-spend-over-25000">advice on publishing spend over £25,000</a>, including templates and published examples.</p>
<p>Local government must publish information every month or as soon as it becomes available. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-government-transparency-code-2015">local government transparency code</a> explains what local authorities should publish and when.</p>
<h3 id="add-new-spend-data">Add new spend data</h3>
<p>To add a new dataset, sign into the <a href="https://ckan.publishing.service.gov.uk/">Data Publisher</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>Find the dataset you want to update.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Manage</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Add data</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Add new resource</strong> and add details of the dataset you want to upload.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Publish</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The new data will be added to the existing dataset.</p>
