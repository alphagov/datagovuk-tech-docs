# Get and manage accounts

To publish and manage datasets on data.gov.uk you must have an administrator (admin) or editor account.

Each account is associated with an organisation responsible for the dataset. For example, a local authority or central government department.

Editors and admins can both create and edit datasets, but admins can also:

* add and remove editors
* manage editors’ activity
* update information about their organisation(s)

Editors and admins can join multiple organisations.

## Get an account

If you can’t find an existing member to invite you, you can [register for an account](https://data.gov.uk/support).
