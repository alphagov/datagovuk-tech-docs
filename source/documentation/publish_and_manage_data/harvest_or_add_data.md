# Harvest or add data

You can publish datasets to data.gov.uk by:

* using software to [harvest datasets](harvest_data/#harvest-data)
* [adding datasets manually](add_data/#add-data-manually)

Harvesting means using software, known as a ‘harvester’, to collect datasets from your website and publish them on data.gov.uk. Using the harvester lets you publish more than one dataset at once. You can also schedule harvests.
