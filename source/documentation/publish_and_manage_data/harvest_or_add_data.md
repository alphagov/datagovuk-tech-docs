# Harvest or add data

You can publish datasets to data.gov.uk by:

* using software to [harvest datasets](harvest_data/#harvest-data)
* [adding datasets manually](add_data/#add-data-manually) using a form

Harvesting means using software built by data.gov.uk, known as a ‘harvester’, to collect datasets from your website and publish them on data.gov.uk. Using the harvester lets you publish more than one dataset at once. You can also schedule harvests to keep data.gov.uk up to date.

>You must harvest [Location/INSPIRE data](inspire/#inspire).

Alternatively, you can [add a dataset manually by completing an online form](harvest_or_add_data/#add-data-manually).
