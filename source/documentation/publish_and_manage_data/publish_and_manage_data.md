# Publish and manage datasets

Central government, local authorities and public bodies can publish on data.gov.uk.

Data.gov.uk does not host datasets. Instead, you must first publish the dataset (or supporting document) on your organisationâ€™s website, on GOV.UK or on your service's own hosting.

You can then add the dataset to data.gov.uk, which will display a description and a link to the dataset.

* [harvest or add data](harvest_or_add_data/#harvest-or-add-data)
* [manage published data](managing_published_data/#managing-published-data)
