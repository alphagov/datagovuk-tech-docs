# Publish and manage datasets

Data.gov.uk does not host datasets. Instead, you must first publish the dataset (or supporting document) on your organisation's website, on GOV.UK or on your service's own hosting.

You can then add the dataset to data.gov.uk, which will display a description and a link to the dataset.

* [manage an existing account](get_and_manage_accounts/#add-or-remove-editors-and-admins)
* [harvest or add data](harvest_or_add_data/#harvest-or-add-data)
* [manage published data](managing_published_data/#managing-published-data)
