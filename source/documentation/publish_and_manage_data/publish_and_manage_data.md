# Publish and manage datasets

Data.gov.uk does not host datasets. Instead, you must first publish the dataset on your organisation’s website or on GOV.UK.

You can then add the dataset to data.gov.uk, which will display a description and a link to the dataset.

* [get an account](get_and_manage_accounts/#get-an-account)
* [manage an existing account](get_and_manage_accounts/#add-or-remove-editors-and-admins)
* [harvest or add data](harvest_or_add_data/#harvest-or-add-data)
* [manage published data](managing_published_data/#managing-published-data)
